# AndroidDex

This is an attempt to learn Kotlin/Android development. It was based majorly on https://github.com/android/architecture-samples . Many things were learned. Two way binding with ui interaction. Database is offline and loads from a json asset file. 

# Objects
1. Learn the basics of MVVM in android 
2. Basics of dependency injection with Dagger 2
3. Navigation/State management
4. Testing (Instrumentation/Unit)
5. File/Assest manipulation

# Libraries
1. com.amitshekhar.android:debug-db - Debugging Room Databases
2. Espresso - Testing Runner
3. Hamcrest - Tetsing Assertion
3. Room - Databases
4. Timber - Logging

# Achievments
1. Using workmanager seed database on install only, from json asset file. 
2. Dynamically build resourceid for use of binding ui images and links.
3. Grasped a basic understanding of mvvm architecture. 

# Todos
1. Complete Instrumentation tests. Current issue applies - Tests pass one at a time fail together.
